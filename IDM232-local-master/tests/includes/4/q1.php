  <h2>Task 01</h2>
  <p>Use PHP to create a link that points to a file <i>result_1.php</i>.</p>
  <p>The link should also pass the following information to the <i>result_1.php</i> page as part of the URL:</p>
  <pre>
id: 22
name: Anthony
  </pre>
  <p>Print your link to the page, and then click on it to test it is working properly. <small>Hint: don't forget to use a <i>target window</i> attribute on your link so it opens in a new tab.</small></p>

  <pre>
ID: 22
Name: Anthony
  </pre>

  <pre class="solution">
    <?php
    //Your solution here.
    
    // end your solution
    ?>
  </pre>
