  <h2>Task 03</h2>
  <p>I need a form!</p>
  <p>We're going to create a front end for a user to log into our system. I need a form that will collect two pieces of information:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>the user's name</li>
    <li>the user's password</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There is already a file setup that will process the form once it's sent, you need to create the HTML form that will collect the information from the user and send it to our results page. The name of the results page file is <i>results_2.php</i>.</p>
  <p><b>Rules:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The user must fill in both their name and password before the form can be submitted.</li>
    <li>The password must be hidden as the user types in the input field.</li>
    <li>The <i>name</i> attributes for your form elements should be:
      <ul>
        <li>name</li>
        <li>password</li>
        <li>submit</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your build for the form successfully, the <i>result_2.php</i> page will display:</p>
  <pre>
Name: (the name entered in the form)
Password: (the password entered in the form)
  </pre>
  <p>Build the form, fill it out and submit it to test.</p>
